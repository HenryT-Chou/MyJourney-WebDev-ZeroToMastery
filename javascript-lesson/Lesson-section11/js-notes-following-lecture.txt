Number = (+,-,*,%, **, ++, --)
string - text (" "), \ = ignore the next char,
=== means equal to

var cannot be a number, use camelcase (firstName, applePie)
var first = prompt("enter 1st number");  (prompt will store as string)

Number (second) will covert the value stored in second to nums instead of strings

calculator example:
var first = prompt("enter 1st number"); 
var second = prompt("enter 2nd number");
var sum = Number(first) + Number(second);
alert ("The sum is: " + sum);
